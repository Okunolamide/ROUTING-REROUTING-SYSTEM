# Getting started

## 1. *MESSAGING APP(SOCIAL PROFILE)*

> Just like every other social profiles, this will be like a messaging profile where students can connect with one another on campus, talk to one another and create groups.

## 2. *CONNECTING WITH SELLERS(MARKETPLACE)*

> This may seem like an e-commerce buh it is not. It's more like a multi-vendor e-commerce. Different sellers can set up their profiles online with their own pages and they can create profile on the web app as a seller and student (nonetheless, their products will be limited to categories).

> This is an initiative to solve the issue of posting needlessly and tirelessly on WhatsApp groups or sfuff.. through this, they get to meet with different buyers and lot.


***

# 3. *ESCROW PAYMENTS STRUCTURE(FINANCE)*

    This has to do with how payments for products are being made.

> For the purpose of fairness.

***

# 4. *LIBRARY FUNCTION*

 * This is just an addon page.
```
Instead of adding blog

>we will add this in the project... Students from all departments can make use of this function to search materials online, or books saved locally. That is, this function will be connected to both online and books saved locally. 
 



***
